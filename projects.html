<h2 id="release-engineering-react-native">Release Engineering: React Native</h2>
<p><img src="/images/phone.png" alt="mobile"></p>
<p>Facebook has made a pretty bold investment in the cross-platform framework, <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a>, and I&#39;m thinking through the process of shipping apps built with this.</p>
<p>Having a say in the entire stack that renders an app unlocks some interesting technological solutions to the way we ship mobile apps. Hopefully I&#39;ll soon be able to share our experiences with them.</p>
<h2 id="sms-auto-routing">SMS Auto-Routing</h2>
<p><img src="/images/phone.png" alt="mobile"></p>
<p>As is repeated all too often in The Valley, scaling is a hard problem. Facebook sends a mind-numbing number of SMS messages to people every day around the world. I led the effort to re-build the system that chooses a route such that it improves delivery rates and provides transparency into how it operates.</p>
<p>It is much easier to build a complicated, opaque system than a simple, understandable one. I&#39;ve learned time and again that the latter is a better option: you can iterate on something you understand, and a simple stack is by definition easier to maintain.</p>

<p>I used to tech lead Facebook&#39;s team responsible for the influx of new users. We monitor <a href="http://www.thestreet.com/story/12051899/1/a-sneak-peak-at-whats-really-behind-facebooks-growth.html">Growth</a>, and pay special interest to emerging markets where people are grappling with concepts about online living that we take for granted.</p>
<p>I spent two and a half years on this team, and in that time we&#39;ve shifted our focus to people with limited access to the internet through their <a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/android/">Android</a> phones. A major contribution of mine was a logging funnel; which doesn&#39;t sound too sexy until you realize how key it is to understanding intent and retention. For technical reasons, Facebook&#39;s established <a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/520580318041111/airlock-facebook-s-mobile-a-b-testing-framework/">A/B testing framework</a> didn&#39;t work for us out of the box, so we leveraged my work here to efficiently experiment in native apps.</p>
<p>Ping me for chai / coffee if you want to hear about some of the challenges we&#39;ve tackled.</p>
<h2 id="dog-programming-language">Dog Programming Language</h2>
<p><img src="/images/person.png" alt="human"> <img src="/images/lab.png" alt="research"></p>
<p>This was a project with Sep Kamvar and his students to make <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/429544/new-programming-language-makes-coding-social-apps-easier/">a programming language</a> that captures the richness of human social interactions. This built on earlier work to create a <a href="http://zahanm.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Jabberwocky-UIST2011.pdf">&quot;social computing stack&quot;</a> that allows one to author a program that weaves together regular computational work with tasks that a person can execute.</p>
<p>Later, I spent a summer at the <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/research/groups/social-computing">Media Lab</a> working on applications of this language: like people coming together to create a piece of artwork, or help each other learn a new skill. Sep even exhibited some of this work at a <a href="http://www.adk.lu.se/en/index.php?id=247">museum</a> in Sweden, which was of course fun to tag along for.</p>
<h2 id="teaching-programming">Teaching Programming</h2>
<p><img src="/images/code.png" alt="open source"> <img src="/images/lab.png" alt="research"> <img src="/images/data.png" alt="data analysis"></p>
<p>Alex Ji and I started <a href="https://physics91si.stanford.edu">a class</a> based on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">software carpentry</a> principle. The idea is that programming is a tool that people across disciplines need to master. We taught physicists, biologists, etc. the basics of programming in Python, writing code in a sustainable manner and analyzing data with numpy and matplotlib. Anyone who has worked in a scientific lab will attest to how messy the software development techniques can be; I&#39;m told we made a dent in that problem at Stanford Physics at least.</p>
<p>I went back to the class as a guest lecturer a few years later to talk about data analysis at Facebook. To assist, I made this toy framework <a href="https://github.com/zahanm/abtest-learn">abtest-learn</a> that simulates running experiments for us to analyze.</p>
<h2 id="power-editor">Power Editor</h2>
<p><img src="/images/f.png" alt="facebook"> <img src="/images/code.png" alt="open source"></p>
<p>At Facebook, I worked on a client-driven Javascript web app, before it was cool to do so. The creator of <a href="http://blog.ukijs.org/">ukijs</a> was my intern mentor, and the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ads/manage/powereditor">Power Editor</a> was our test bed. We dealt with the scaling problems that modern Javascript tries to address, and I collaborated with great engineers who went on to make frameworks you may be familiar with like <a href="http://shaneosullivan.github.io/boltjs/gettingstarted.html">Bolt</a> and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html">React</a>.</p>
<p>We also got a bit of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/01/facebook-circles/">press</a> for a fun hack we did.</p>
