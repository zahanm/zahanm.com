We are currently building the <a href=\"http://dog-lang.org\">Dog</a> programming language, which is made to emphasize the role of humans in computational systems. We are exploring the possibilities that this affords to use human and artificial intelligence as part of hybrid approaches to building smarter applications. I'm helping design the language to be as accessible to those without programming experience, and am also building out the ecosystem of supporting libraries and sample applications."
