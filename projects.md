## SMS Auto-Routing
[facebook] [mobile]

As is repeated all too often in The Valley, scaling is hard. Facebook sends a mind-blowing number of SMS messages to people every day around the world. I led the effort to re-build this system involved such that it improves delivery rates and provides transparency into how it operates.

It's much easier to build a complicated, opaque system than a simple, understandable one. I've learned time and again though that the latter is a better option: you can iterate on something you understand, and a simple stack is tautologically easier to maintain.

## Registration Flow across Interfaces

I tech lead Facebook's team responsible for the influx of new users. We monitor Growth, and pay special interest to emerging markets where people are grappling with concepts about online living that we take for granted.

I've spent two years on this team, and in that time we've shifted our focus to people with limited access to the internet through their Android phones. One of my favorite contributions here was a thought-out funnel infrastructure, which doesn't sound too sexy until you realize how key it is to understanding intent and retention.

Ping me for coffee if you want to hear about some of the challenges we've tackled (even if I'm not a big hot-beverage person).

## Dog Programming Language
[mit] [person]

This was a project with Sep Kamvar and his students to make a programming language that captures the richness of human social interactions. This built on earlier work to create a ["social computing stack"] that allows one to author a program that weaves together regular computational work with tasks that a person can execute.

Later, I spent a summer at the Media Lab working on applications of this language: like people coming together to create a piece of artwork, or help each other learn a new skill. Sep even exhibited some of this work at a [museum] in Sweden, which was of course fun to tag along for.

## Teaching Programming

Alex Ji and I started [a class](https://physics91si.stanford.edu) based on the [software carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) principle. The idea is that programming is a tool that people across disciplines need to master. We taught physicists, biologists, etc. the basics of programming in Python, writing code in a sustainable manner and analyzing data with numpy and matplotlib. Anyone who has worked in a scientific lab will attest to how messy the software development techniques can be; I'm told we made a dent in that problem at Stanford Physics at least.

I went back to the class as a guest lecturer a few years later to talk about data analysis at Facebook. To assist, I made this toy framework [abtest-learn] that simulates running experiments for us to analyze.

## Power Editor

At Facebook, I worked on a client-driven Javascript web app, before it was cool to do so. The creator of [ukijs] was my intern mentor, and the [Power Editor](http://www.facebook.com/ads/manage/powereditor) was our test bed. We dealt with the scaling problems that modern Javascript tries to address, and I collaborated with great engineers who went on to make frameworks you may be familiar with like [Bolt] and [React].

We also got a bit of [press](http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/01/facebook-circles/) for a fun hack we did.
