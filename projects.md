Dog Programming Language
This was a project with Sep Kamvar and his students to make a programming language that captures the richness of human social interactions. This built on earlier work to create a ["social computing stack"] that allows one to author a program that weaves together regular computational work with tasks that a person can execute.

Later, I spent a summer at the Media Lab working on applications of this language: like people coming together to create a piece of artwork, or help each other learn a new skill. Sep even exhibited some of this work at a [museum] in Sweden, which was of course fun to tag along for.

Teaching Programming
Alex Ji and I started [a class](https://physics91si.stanford.edu) based on the [software carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) principle. The idea is that programming is a tool that people across disciplines need to master. We taught physicists, biologists, etc. the basics of programming in Python, writing code in a sustainable manner and analyzing data with numpy and matplotlib. Anyone who has worked in a scientific lab will attest to how messy the software development techniques can be; I'm told we made a dent in that problem at Stanford Physics at least.

I went back to the class as a guest lecturer a few years later to talk about data analysis at Facebook. To assist, I made this toy framework [abtest-learn] that simulates running experiments for us to analyze.

Power Editor
At Facebook, I worked on a client-driven Javascript web app, before it was cool to do so. The creator of [ukijs] was my intern mentor, and the [Power Editor](http://www.facebook.com/ads/manage/powereditor) was our test bed. We dealt with the scaling problems that modern Javascript tries to address, and I collaborated with great engineers who went on to make frameworks you may be familiar with like [Bolt] and [React].

We also got a bit of [press](http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/01/facebook-circles/) for a fun hack we did.
