          <li>Mercifully, no major issues on the health front for all of us, though Amita’s report card could do with some improvement.</li>
          <li>The best part being that Carmen, Amita’s mother, is a sprightly 85, and still works on her editing at least 2 to 3 hours per day. She also has the best social life in the household - inshaallah we will be at 85% of her mental and physical faculties at 85 !!!</li>
          <li>We had our share of house guests, high points being two of Zahan’s Stanford buddies who proved to be delightful young men, on India darshan.</li>
          <li>It was also great having an extended visit from Ayesha, Amita’s sister, who was having health checkups in Mumbai.</li>
          <li>The start of the year saw us in Jaipur for the literary festival, which in spite of the usual Indian chaos, is just such an intellectual 5 day feast, that we have become annual regulars since several years.</li>
          <li>Other travel in the first part of the year saw us  head off to Goa for a beautiful beachy wedding of a friend, full of sun, sea, sand and liquid diet.</li>
          <li>J also  landed up in Bangalore for a surprise 80th birthday celebration of a friend amid much bonhomie with mainly ex-Nigeria buddies.</li>
          <li>The summer break for us consisted of a  visit  to the luscious green tea estates of Munnar and wildlife reserves of Thekkady in Kerala.</li>

          <li>The high point of the year was attending Zahan’s graduation at Stanford in June. We were there for a fortnight, replete with the ceremonies, graduation bashes, and celebration that US universities do to perfection. Cory Booker, Mayor of Newark, who is a charismatic politician to watch, was the outstanding Commencement speaker. The finale of the trip was a grand party for Malkani friends hosted by J’s Stanford classmate Barbara at her beautiful home in Danville.We also did trips to  Monterey, Carmel, SF etc.</li>

          <li>A went, as she does every summer, to London and France, for her work meetings.</li>
          <li>October was a really sad time for us all as we lost our dear friend Jorge.  An old and dear friend from our Nigeria days, Jorge was the life and soul of every party and was much loved by us all. J went to Goa for the final ceremonies.</li>

          <li>The house in now in its fourth season since construction. Mercifully, some unwelcome repairs are  now over and the house is back in good nick.</li>
          <li>However, it also means constant maintenance issues  and includes dealings with  staff, repairs, dealing with avaricious local officials et al.</li>
          <li>However, it is still a major source of joy on most weekends and it is great to have a sylvan getaway barely an hour’s boat-ride away from this teeming madhouse of a city.</li>

          <li>He graduated from Stanford in December, with degrees in Physics and Computer Science.</li>
          <li>He is down in India for his Xmas break, and goes back to California to start working in January.</li>
          <li>He is thinking of returning to academia for a PhD at some stage, but let’s see if that gets watered down once he joins the workforce. He would like to return to Boston, where he spent the summer.</li>
          <li>Somewhere in his psyche though, there remains the start-up bug bequeathed to him by The Valley.</li>

          <li>Is in Grade 10, which is a much hyped year in the Indian school system.</li>
          <li>In February he  went to Boston with his school to the Harvard Model United Nations tamasha. The piece de resistance was that he then took off on his own across the continent to bond with his brother at Stanford for a few days.</li>
          <li>Though football has taken a back-seat for now, V has discovered the joys of the keyboard and playing in a band!</li>
          <li>Of course, constant SMSes, gals, and other pleasures of adolescence are very much present in his life.</li>
          <li>He will stay on, in the same school till grade 12, after which hopefully he will head for the US for his undergraduate studies.</li>
