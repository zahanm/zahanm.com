We are currently building the Dog programming language, which is made to emphasize the role of humans in computational systems. We are exploring the possibilities that this affords to use human and artificial intelligence as part of hybrid approaches to building smarter applications. I'm helping design the language to be as accessible to those without programming experience, and am also building out the ecosystem of supporting libraries and sample applications."

We worked on solving the problems of natural language translation by focussing on extracting meaning from unstructured text. Using the games with a purpose approach, I co-developed an experiment in lie detection that we launched as The Detection Game."

Specifically, I worked on the (now open-sourced) Powereditor that lets advertisers manage their ad campaigns in bulk, with advanced offline and exporting capabilities. The unprecedented freedom I was afforded to develop this app really helped me grow as an individual and an engineer."

I worked on computational data analysis of simulations of structure formation in the early Universe, using the IDL programming language. During the summer, I looked at the properties of dark matter halos and their sub-halos."
