        <p>The most significant event of the year has been the passing of Cleo, our black and tan dachshund, much loved by all, in early October this year. We were glad to let her go after 12 years with us since illness was making her life difficult. She was by far the most wonderful dog we have had to date; loving, and good-natured. We will miss her.</p>
        <p>The year began with our annual 5 day stimulating pilgrimage to the Jaipur Literary festival, an event we always look forward to.</p>
        <p>In summer the whole family converged for a fortnight in Italy and we visited Rome, Florence and Venice. We reveled in the historical, cultural and culinary delights of the Roman republic.</p>

        <p>We’re looking forward to a reunited family heading to Alibagh for the last week of December. Along with Carmen and Ayesha we will bid goodbye to 2013 together.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Mercifully the five year old house, after teething construction issues, is in good nick.</p>
        <p>Sadly, thanks to tracking the activities of our mercurial 16 year old, we just do not get there often enough. We must have spent a maximum of 10 nights there thus far this year.</p>
        <p>Lots of fire-fighting and crisis management day trips are par for the course, coping with blackmailing neighbouring farmers, rapacious petty officials, and staff issues. However, still a major source of joy!</p>

        <p>Vivan is in class 11 at Cathedral, where he chose to stay on for the last two years. Many of his classmates opted for other options, such as junior college, after class 10.</p>
        <p>He is an enthusiastic participant in Model United Nations (MUN) programmes and is also a keen debater, football fiend, diligent pianist, active member of a band... the list of activities is endless... and exhausting!</p>
        <p>He is clearly the most itinerant member of the household. His school trips this year have taken him to Darjeeling in April, and yet again on a school delegation to Japan in May, Assam in August and Delhi in September! January 2014 will see him return to Harvard for another MUN.</p>

        <p>In June, he moved up to an apartment in San Francisco, in the Mission district. It has figured recently in press highlighting the gentrification of the city by SF’s new tech talent, a topic dear to his interests since he started working at Facebook at the start of the year.</p>
        <p>The cultural delights of SF have kept his interests engaged, and by all accounts he is having a wonderful time. Cycling has become a an active hobby, and he occasionally regales us with stories of his weekend ride adventures.</p>

        <p>She is now in her 7th year of running Inlaks Foundation in India. The Foundation has expanded the scope of its activities beyond the traditional role of awarding post-graduate scholarships to bright Indians for further foreign studies and she is now buried under a pile of work all through the year.</p>
        <p>In January, the ‘fearsome foursome’ from Modern School.  Amita, Anamika, Nomi and Bina met in Trivandrum at the wedding of Bina’s daughter, Malu. It was the first time that the four were together with kids in tow. Only Vivan missed out, as he had school examinations at the time..</p>
        <p>In March a girls trip to Tadoba, a game sanctuary in Maharashtra, took place with great tiger sightings, as you can see!</p>

        <p>Continues to be a stockbroker, although pickings are slim in the highly competitive environment.</p>
        <p>Culturally he continues to be irrepressible, not missing out any cultural festival, play, movie, concert in sight.</p>
        <p>October saw him going to San Francisco for a fortnight to attend the 20th reunion of his Sloan class at Stanford. About half of his class showed up from all parts of the world for much revelry, nostalgia and hectic partying. The collateral benefit was that father and son bonded for a week in SF. Zahan indulging his pater with jazz, Segway rides, Vivaldi, hikes and more. The old man kept up admirably!</p>

        <p>In November he winged it to Goa for the now infamous THINKFEST, a 3 day intellectual feast with speakers on subjects ranging from pure science to politics to social burning issues.</p>
        <p>Jaggi took off for yet another reunion in December , this time his IIM Calcutta batch, to Sula vineyards in Nasik for 3 days. It's a hard life in the tropics for some! He is a serial reunion man.</p>
